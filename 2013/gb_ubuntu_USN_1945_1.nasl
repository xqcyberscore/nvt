  tag_insight = "A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the
Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service by creating a
large number of files with names that have the same CRC32 hash value.
(CVE-2012-5374)

A denial of service flaw was discovered in the Btrfs file system in the
Linux kernel. A local user could cause a denial of service (prevent file
creation) for a victim, by creating a file with a specific CRC32C hash
value in a directory important to the victim. (CVE-2012-5375)

Vasily Kulikov discovered a flaw in the Linux Kernel's perf tool that
allows for privilege escalation. A local user could exploit this flaw to
run commands as root when using the perf tool. (CVE-2013-1060)

A flaw was discovered in the Xen subsystem of the Linux kernel when it
provides read-only access to a disk that supports TRIM or SCSI UNMAP to a
guest OS. A privileged user in the guest OS could exploit this flaw to
destroy data on the disk, even though the guest OS should not be able to
write to the disk. (CVE-2013-2140)

A flaw was discovered in the Linux kernel when an IPv6 socket is used to
connect to an IPv4 destination. An unprivileged local user could exploit
this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2013-2232)

An information leak was discovered in the IPSec key_socket implementation
in the Linux kernel. An local user could exploit this flaw to examine
potentially sensitive information in kernel memory. (CVE-2013-2234)

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in setsockopt UDP_CORK option in the
Linux kernel's IPv6 stack. A local user could exploit this flaw to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2013-4162)

Hannes Frederic Sowa discovered a flaw in the IPv6 subsystem of the Linux
kernel when the IPV6_MTU setsockopt option has been specified in
combination with the UDP_CORK option. A local user could exploit this flaw
to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2013-4163)";
