tag_insight = "Ryan Sweat discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled certain VLAN
  packets. On some systems, a remote attacker could send specially crafted
  traffic to crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
  (CVE-2011-1576)

  Vasiliy Kulikov and Dan Rosenberg discovered that ecryptfs did not
  correctly check the origin of mount points. A local attacker could exploit
  this to trick the system into unmounting arbitrary mount points, leading to
  a denial of service. (CVE-2011-1833)
  
  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that taskstats did not enforce access
  restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain
  information, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2494)
  
  Vasiliy Kulikov discovered that /proc/PID/io did not enforce access
  restrictions. A local attacker could exploit this to read certain
  information, leading to a loss of privacy. (CVE-2011-2495)
  
  Dan Rosenberg discovered that the Bluetooth stack incorrectly handled
  certain L2CAP requests. If a system was using Bluetooth, a remote attacker
  could send specially crafted traffic to crash the system or gain root
  privileges. (CVE-2011-2497)
  
  It was discovered that the EXT4 filesystem contained multiple off-by-one
  flaws. A local attacker could exploit this to crash the system, leading to
  a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2695)
  
  Fernando Gont discovered that the IPv6 stack used predictable fragment
  identification numbers. A remote attacker could exploit this to exhaust
  network resources, leading to a denial of service. (CVE-2011-2699)
  
  Christian Ohm discovered that the perf command looks for configuration
  files in the current directory. If a privileged user were tricked into
  running perf in a directory containing a malicious configuration file, an
  attacker could run arbitrary commands and possibly gain privileges.
  (CVE-2011-2905)
  
  Time Warns discovered that long symlinks were incorrectly handled on Be
  filesystems. A local attacker could exploit this with a malformed Be
  filesystem and crash the system, leading to a denial of service.
  (CVE-2011-2928)
  
  Dan Kaminsky discovered that the kernel incorrectly handled random sequence
  number generation. An attacker could use this flaw to possibly predict
  sequence numbers and inject packets. (CVE-2011-3188)
  
  Darren Lavender discovered that the CIFS client incorrectly handled certain
  large values. A remote attacker with a malicious server could exploit this
  to crash the system or possibly execute arbitrary code as the root user.
