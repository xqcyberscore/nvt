tag_insight = "OpenSSL is a toolkit that implements the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3)
  and Transport Layer Security (TLS v1) protocols, as well as a
  full-strength, general purpose cryptography library.

  It was found that the OpenSSL library did not properly re-initialize its
  internal state in the SSL_library_init() function after previous calls to
  the CRYPTO_cleanup_all_ex_data() function, which would cause a memory leak
  for each subsequent SSL connection. This flaw could cause server
  applications that call those functions during reload, such as a combination
  of the Apache HTTP Server, mod_ssl, PHP, and cURL, to consume all available
  memory, resulting in a denial of service. (CVE-2009-4355)
  
  Dan Kaminsky found that browsers could accept certificates with MD2 hash
  signatures, even though MD2 is no longer considered a cryptographically
  strong algorithm. This could make it easier for an attacker to create a
  malicious certificate that would be treated as trusted by a browser.
  OpenSSL now disables the use of the MD2 algorithm inside signatures by
  default. (CVE-2009-2409)
  
  All OpenSSL users should upgrade to these updated packages, which contain
  backported patches to resolve these issues. For the update to take effect,
  all services linked to the OpenSSL library must be restarted, or the system
  rebooted.";
